Deck of Cards

I chose to make a Card class and a Deck class in order to keep the code more clean and understandable. The Card class would 
solely need to know its suit and rank. The Deck class would generate the objects of the Card class and hold all those Cards inside an array (which 
would comprise the deck). 

I decided that calling GetNextCard() wouldn't actually modify the contents of the cards array in Deck. It would simply return
the value of the next card, not remove the item from the array. Thus, my Shuffle method, which returns all the cards to the deck, 
took this information into account. If Shuffle is called a second time, it doesn't shuffle a deck of cards that is perfectly in 
order. It shuffles the deck from its current shuffled state (the state when you called Shuffle for the first time) by simpling
resetting the variable that keeps track of where the top card is. 

I would determine that my framework is working correctly by including a function that prints out the values of all the cards
of the deck, and double check that all suits and ranks are represented. I would also compare a list of cards generated by calling
GenNextCard 52 times with the shuffled deck to see if GenNextCard correctly outputs the next card in the deck.
